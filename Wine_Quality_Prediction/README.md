## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains various physicochemical properties of red and white wines, along with their quality ratings. You can find the dataset in the `data` directory. 


## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries and tools:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided Jupyter notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask (for deployment, if required)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arijit258/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks.


## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps are essential for preparing the dataset for machine learning. These steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical features (if any), and scaling/normalizing numerical features.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building predictive models, it's important to gain insights from the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

## Machine Learning Models

This project includes the implementation of various machine learning models for wine quality prediction, such as:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


## Evaluation

The total accuracy is 67%
