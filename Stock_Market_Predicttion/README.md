# Microsoft Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Model

This repository contains a Python-based project for predicting Microsoft's stock price using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series data, making it an excellent choice for stock price prediction.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the following key components:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock price data for Microsoft from a reliable data source. For this project, we will use Yahoo Finance.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for training the LSTM model. This step includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **LSTM Model**: Build and train an LSTM model to learn and predict future stock prices. The model will be implemented using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the actual and predicted stock prices to gain insights into the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow (or PyTorch)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arijit258/Stock_Market_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd Stock_Market_Prediction
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository to execute the project. This will guide you through the entire process from data collection to model evaluation.

## Data Collection

The project assumes that you have already obtained historical Microsoft stock price data. In the provided Jupyter Notebook, you can replace the sample data with your own data source.

## Model Training

The LSTM model is implemented in a separate Python script or Jupyter Notebook. You can customize the architecture, hyperparameters, and other settings as needed to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance will be evaluated using standard regression metrics. You can modify the evaluation metrics and criteria according to your specific needs.
